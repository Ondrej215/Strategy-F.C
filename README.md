# Strategy F.C.

Welcome to **Strategy F.C.**, a comprehensive football management simulation game where you take on the role of manager at a club that has just made it into professional football.

## Features
- **Realistic team management**: Handle transfers, tactics, and training.
- **Unique Opponents**: Each match brings a different challenge, what works against one team will not work as effectively against every opponent
- **Multiple leagues**: Manage teams across different leagues and win numerous tournaments to add trophies to your trophy cabinet.

**Check Your DPI Settings**
   - After launching the game, go to the **Main Menu** and navigate to **Settings** on the main menu.
   - Check if your DPI setting is accurate for your display. This ensures that the game's UI elements are displayed correctly.
   - If necessary, adjust your DPI setting in the code:
  
     - 1. **Locate the Setting**: 
  - Open the python code and locate the DPI_SCALE constant found around line 10

2. **Modify the DPI Value**: 
   - Adjust the `DPI` value to match your display's DPI.
   - You may need to do some trial and error to find your device's value

3. **Save and Relaunch**: 
   - Save the file and restart the game to apply the changes.

### Caution:
- Be careful when editing the code! Only adjust the `DPI` setting unless you know what you're doing. Incorrect changes could cause the game to malfunction.

## System Requirements
- If you are reading this, you are probably good to go
